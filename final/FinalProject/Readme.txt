Basic instructions
- Most of the capitalized words that you see in descriptions can be used as commands (ex: WORKBENCH).
- You can also use "Examine", "Inventory", and "Quit" as commands. Commands are not case-sensitive.
- Navigate rooms and observe objects to learn a bit of lore/story/history of the game's world.
- In total there are 5 rooms, 3 pickup-able items, and 5 observable objects (structures).

Making everything work was a lot more difficult and time consuming than expected. In the end I didn't have
time to add a couple features I wanted (like endings and having to clear obstacles with specific items).
